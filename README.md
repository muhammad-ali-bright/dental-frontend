### State Management Architecture

1. **AuthContext** - Manages user authentication and session
2. **AppContext** - Handles patients and appointments data
3. **localStorage** - Persists all data locally with mock data initialization

### Data Models

#### User Interface
```typescript
interface User {
  id: string;
  role: 'Admin' | 'Patient';
  email: string;
  password: string;
  patientId?: string;
}
```

#### Patient Interface
```typescript
interface Patient {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  dob: string;
  contact: string;
  notes: string;
  email?: string;
}
```

#### Appointment/Appointment Interface
```typescript
interface Appointment {
  id: string;
  patientId: string;
  title: string;
  description: string;
  comments: string;
  appointmentDate: string;
  cost?: number;
  treatment?: string;
  status: 'Scheduled' | 'In Progress' | 'Completed' | 'Cancelled';
  nextDate?: string;
  files: FileAttachment[];
}
```

## 🎯 Key Features Implementation

### File Upload System
- **Base64 Encoding** - Files converted to base64 for localStorage storage
- **Multiple File Types** - Support for PDF, DOC, images
- **File Preview & Download** - Complete file management interface

### Calendar Integration
- **Monthly/Weekly Views** - Interactive calendar with appointment visualization
- **Day Selection** - Click-to-view daily appointments
- **Appointment Indicators** - Visual markers for scheduled dates

### Responsive Design
- **Mobile-First Approach** - Optimized for all screen sizes
- **Collapsible Navigation** - Mobile-friendly sidebar
- **Touch-Friendly Controls** - Accessible on all devices

### Data Persistence
- **localStorage Integration** - All data persisted locally
- **Automatic Initialization** - Mock data loaded on first visit
- **Session Management** - User sessions maintained across browser restarts

## 🚨 Known Issues & Limitations

### Current Limitations
1. **File Storage** - Large files may cause performance issues due to base64 encoding
2. **Data Scalability** - localStorage has size limitations (~5-10MB)
3. **No Real-time Sync** - Multiple tabs may have data inconsistencies
4. **Basic Search** - Simple text-based filtering only

### Browser Compatibility
- **Modern Browsers** - Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge (latest versions)
- **Mobile Browsers** - iOS Safari, Chrome Mobile
- **localStorage Required** - Application won't work without localStorage support

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Advanced Search & Filtering** - Multi-criteria search with date ranges
2. **Appointment Reminders** - Browser notifications for upcoming appointments
3. **Data Export** - PDF reports and CSV exports
4. **Advanced Calendar Features** - Drag-and-drop appointment scheduling
5. **Treatment Templates** - Pre-defined treatment workflows
6. **Patient Communication** - In-app messaging system

### Technical Debt
1. **Error Boundaries** - Better error handling and user feedback
2. **Unit Testing** - Comprehensive test coverage
3. **Performance Optimization** - Virtual scrolling for large datasets
4. **Accessibility** - WCAG compliance improvements

## 🎨 Design Decisions

### UI/UX Choices
- **Color Scheme** - Medical blue (#2563eb) for trust and professionalism
- **Typography** - Clean, readable fonts suitable for medical applications
- **Icons** - Lucide React for consistent, modern iconography
- **Layout** - Card-based design for easy information scanning

### Technical Decisions
- **TypeScript** - Type safety and better development experience
- **Context API** - Simpler than Redux for this application scope
- **TailwindCSS** - Rapid development with utility-first CSS
- **React Router** - Standard routing solution for React applications
